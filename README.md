Proper README is when done.

~/~/~ What to work on: ~/~/~
W-1. [DONE] favicon.ico and .png; logo => Must make logo for mine and use it for both, as well for the (A) for when minimising/Tablet view. [Done with DMS, to change with my own later]
W-2. [IN PROGRESS] Remove Products and replace with Paletes, to generate code for tracking and everything from the notes.
W-3. [TO BE TESTED] Make PFP to update automatically after first update.
W-4. [FIXED] Fix 'Edit User' Button. (must be 'profile' instead of 'edit' of http://localhost/Transportation-of-goods-Bulgaria/index.php?controller=User&action=edit&id=1 e.g)
W-5. [95% DONE/Excluding Courier Tracking] UPDATE THE ENTIRE SITE's PREVIEW (The Dashboard thing.)

============= USING THIS AS TEMPORARY LOG =============
==== March 10-11th, 2025 ====
We have finally received our diploma thesises' requirements, and boy, I am so off at places. Got to edit it all in like a month and a half to have a week for the 30-page documentation! .w.

==== March 18th, 2025 ====
Base was lost, but later recovered, thanks to @veselinnikolaev, my classmate for helping me and lending me his (since they have similar functionality).
Time to remaster it fully to fit my own stuff in!

==== April 1st, 2025 ====
Slight rework after school stress. Templates found: [I can use HTTrack, so I do not have to make an account.]

==== April 3rd 2025 ====
We are getting real, slowly.

==== April 4-6th 2025 ====
Dashboard enhancements. Price-decision table is a bit off in its sorting when it comes to pricing. As of April 6th, FAQs and Contacts are worked on. The DB is done... in its old variant, got to update it to the new one now.

==== April 7th 2025 ====
Mentor meeting, she said I could use Google Maps API and for the tracking - VarnaTraffic's, interesting, since VT has no API.

==== April 8th 2025 ====
Looks better, Contacts almost done. A lot of early issues are fixed! Now, time to modify!

==== April 14th 2025 ====
A lot of progress and fixes. Another mentor meeting today, got some more directions.

--- Notes: (Copied from the Notepad I wrote) ---
== For the 30-page v ==
Tables' purposes for Thesis (30 pages)
Scheme first. Explain more complicated functions after the tables; explain project's goals and how it helps and what it does.
== For the 30-page ^ ==
v TO-DO ^
== For Site v ==
No trucks or vehicles for couriers, unneeded.
CUSTOM Setting for couriers to allow tracking;
Highscores for couriers. (km/packets/clients(--))
--Can make discounts after every 3 orders by 1.5% with cap of 12%.
Couriers to be tracked - all when ADMIN/Root, relevant by User.
Status for being busy for couriers.
--Activity Section - how much time is spent on site; how many orders/how many log ins and all sorts of statistics for the user. Make history of orders per user and show the time it took to arrive.
Another reminder for pallete one day prior. [-- means "eventually" in these Notes!]
Add Start and End Point (both with Address or Office)!! (And it means make the PHP values in a DB to extract them .w.)
== For Site ^ ==

==== April 20th 2025 ====
Changes are slower. Looking up the changes mentioned for the site, this will be time-consuming. I need to fix the currency bug. I need to focus on my thesis' 30 pages too...

==== April 21st 2025 ====
Currency bug is fixed. To add - Start/End points and their choices (address (postcodes) or at office directly), should be done soon. Also, my silly self on a single braincell has written 2024 instead of 2025 in some dates in the README, oof. Map will be the biggest challenge yet.

==== April 23rd 2025 ====
No Postal codes. Focus on Address conversion. And the DBs.
